# Smartphone Price Prediction using XGBoost

##  Overview
This project aims to predict smartphone prices using a machine learning model based on various features such as RAM, storage, battery capacity, camera specifications, and more. The model is built using the **XGBoost** algorithm, with comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation to ensure accurate predictions. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature transformations, outlier handling, and model performance assessment.
