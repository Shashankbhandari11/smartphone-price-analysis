📱 Smartphone Price Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

📌 Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a smartphone price dataset. The goal is to analyze smartphone prices, uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and extract valuable insights using various statistical and visualization techniques.

✨ Features

🔍 Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicate values, and outliers.

📊 Data Visualization: Utilizing histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between smartphone features and prices.

📈 Statistical Analysis: Generating summary statistics, understanding price distributions, and detecting trends.

🔢 Feature Engineering: Exploring correlations between smartphone specifications (RAM, storage, camera, etc.) and price variations.

📂 Dataset

📍 The dataset used for this project contains smartphone price-related information and is stored in the data/ directory.
✅ Ensure you have the required dataset file (data/smartphone_price_data.csv) before running the notebook.

🛠 Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

🚀 Usage

1️⃣ Clone this repository:

git clone <repository-url>

2️⃣ Navigate to the project directory:

cd smartphone-price-eda-project

3️⃣ Switch to the EDA branch:

git checkout eda-analysis

4️⃣ Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Restored_EDA.ipynb

5️⃣ Run the cells step by step to perform EDA on smartphone price data.

📊 Visualizations

This project includes multiple visualizations to understand smartphone price trends better:

📌 Price Distribution of Smartphones

📌 Impact of RAM and Storage on Price

📌 Battery Life vs Price Analysis

📌 Feature Correlations (Camera, Display, Brand, etc.) with Price

📌 Price Trends Over Time

📈 Results & Insights

After performing EDA, key insights about the smartphone price dataset are summarized in the notebook, highlighting trends, patterns, and important findings.
